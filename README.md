<h1>Digit Recognition using Neural Networks</h1>
<p>This project implements a neural network model for recognizing handwritten digits from the popular <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">MNIST dataset</a>. The model is designed to classify digits (0-9) based on image pixel data.</p>
<p>The project demonstrates key steps in building, training, and evaluating a neural network model for image classification, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Data preprocessing and normalization</li>
  <li>Model architecture selection (using fully connected layers)</li>
  <li>Training with backpropagation and optimization techniques</li>
  <li>Evaluation of model accuracy</li>
</ul>
<p>Explore this project to learn how neural networks can be applied to image recognition tasks!</p>
